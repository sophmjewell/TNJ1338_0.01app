# JWST NIRCam and HST ACS Images of the TN J1338 field in the resolution of NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy.

---

This directory contains JWST NIRCam and HST ACS photometry of a 0.2205 square acrsecond area of sky around the radio galaxy TN J1338-1942, resampled to the spatial resolution of NIRSpec IFU observations. The images are provided in fits format.

The observations include the following filters:
* JWST F150W
* JWST F182M
* JWST F210M
* JWST F300M
* JWST F335M
* JWST F360M
* HST F475W
* HST F625W
* HST F775W
* HST F850LP

In the NIRSpec IFU observations, the nominal pixel area is 0.01 square arcseconds. The JWST NIRCam images were resampled to this IFU resolution from an original pixel area of ~0.0009 square arcseconds, and the HST ACS from ~0.0016 square arcseconds. Further information about the properties of this data product can be found in the headers of the fits images.

These filters cover most of the rest-frame UV and optical emission from the galaxy TN J1338-1942, which lies at z~4.11 (e.g. see [Duncan et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/3/4548/7147315), [Saxena et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12199), [Roy et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11612) etc.).
