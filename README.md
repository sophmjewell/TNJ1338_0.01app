# JWST NIRCam and HST ACS Images of the TN J1338 field in the resolution of NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy.

---

This directory contains JWST NIRCam and HST ACS photometry of a 0.2205 square acrsecond area of sky around the radio galaxy TN J1338-1942, resampled to the 0.01 arcsec/pixel resolution of NIRSpec IFU observations. The images are provided in fits format.

The observations include the following filters:
* JWST F150W
* JWST F182M
* JWST F210M
* JWST F300M
* JWST F335M
* JWST F360M
* HST F475W
* HST F625W
* HST F775W
* HST F850LP

These filters cover most of the rest-frame UV and optical emission from the galaxy TN J1338-1942, which lies at z~4.11 (e.g. see [Duncan et al. (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/3/4548/7147315), [Saxena et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12199), [Roy et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11612) etc.).
